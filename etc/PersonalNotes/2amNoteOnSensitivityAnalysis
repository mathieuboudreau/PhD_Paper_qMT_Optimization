To adjust counter the effect of a change in delta(B1), a linear combination change of all other parameters
must be done with varying weights. Can we assume that these weights are proportional (actually, inversely proportional?)
to the sensitivities for the set of mt measurements (they would, wouldn't they, be for a single measurement).
Something of the sorts
